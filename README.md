This repository is destined to hold files in order to display some of the main Data Analytical skills developed by me, Gustavo Garofalo, in the past couple of years.

Most of the skills displayed here were learned either by self studying or formal education, one of which is the Data Analytics and Visualization Bootcamp, an intensive 24 week program offered by the University of Central Florida (Cerificate awarded in March 2020).

In this folder you will find projects like the "Nasa_Webscrape", that combines a lot of different tools to scrape the web for information. This project specifically, uses a Flask Application to access websites and retrieve information from them, by accessing its HTML contents. Not only that, but the applications also uses HTML and CSS to render the information retrieved from the third parties, to display in a web page.
It is an phenomenal set of skills, that can be easily applied to every kind of industry.

The skill displayed in this repository is Web Scraping. Some of the skills used are: HTML, CSS, Flask, PyMongo, Splinter and Beutifull soup.
